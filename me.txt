I'm NL Schwab, a young human explorer from Earth, 24 years old.
I am a female person of short stature, specially trained in physics and soft matter.
I have no supernatural abilities, though my difficulties shaving makes some think I'm a 
werewolf.
I devote myself to the beautiful aspects of life, such as art, my partner, and my shiny 
car.
